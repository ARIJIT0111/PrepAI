## 💡 About The Project

**PrepAI** is an intelligent interview preparation platform built with the **MERN Stack** and **Google's Gemini API**.

It moves beyond static "Top 100 Interview Questions" lists by acting as a dynamic interview coach. Whether you are a Junior Developer or a Senior Architect, PrepAI generates tailored questions, evaluates your knowledge, and explains complex concepts instantly.

## ❓ The Problem Statement

**Why do candidates struggle with traditional preparation?**

1.  **Static Content:** Reading long lists of PDF questions is boring and passive. You don't learn; you memorize.
2.  **One-Size-Fits-All:** A "Java Interview" list doesn't distinguish between a fresher and a 5-year expert.
3.  **Lack of Feedback:** When you get stuck on a question, static lists don't explain *why* or break down the concept.
4.  **Disorganized:** Candidates lose track of which important questions they need to revisit.
